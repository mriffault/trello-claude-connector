### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- An MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, etc.)
- Trello account with API credentials

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kocakli/trello-desktop-mcp.git
   cd trello-desktop-mcp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Get Trello API credentials**
   - Visit https://trello.com/app-key
   - Copy your API Key
   - Generate a Token (never expires, read/write access)

5. **Configure your MCP client**

   Choose the instructions for your client below:

   <details>
   <summary><strong>Claude Desktop</strong></summary>

   Edit your Claude Desktop configuration file:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

   Add the Trello MCP server:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "trello": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/absolute/path/to/trello-desktop-mcp/dist/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "TRELLO_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
           "TRELLO_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Then restart Claude Desktop.
   </details>

   <details>
   <summary><strong>Claude Code (CLI)</strong></summary>

   Add the server using the Claude Code CLI:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add trello -- node /absolute/path/to/trello-desktop-mcp/dist/index.js \
     -e TRELLO_API_KEY=your-api-key-here \
     -e TRELLO_TOKEN=your-token-here
   ```

   Or add it to your project's `.mcp.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "trello": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/absolute/path/to/trello-desktop-mcp/dist/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "TRELLO_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
           "TRELLO_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   </details>

   <details>
   <summary><strong>Gemini CLI</strong></summary>

   Edit your Gemini CLI settings file at `~/.gemini/settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "trello": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/absolute/path/to/trello-desktop-mcp/dist/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "TRELLO_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here",
           "TRELLO_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   </details>

   <details>
   <summary><strong>Other MCP Clients</strong></summary>

   Any MCP-compatible client that supports stdio transport can use this server. You need to configure it to:
   1. Run `node /absolute/path/to/trello-desktop-mcp/dist/index.js`
   2. Set environment variables `TRELLO_API_KEY` and `TRELLO_TOKEN`

   Refer to your client's documentation for the exact configuration format.
   </details>

6. **Restart your MCP client** to pick up the new configuration.

## Architecture

### MCP Protocol
The server implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides:
- Standardized tool discovery and invocation
- Type-safe parameter validation
- Structured error handling
- Automatic credential management

### Security
- API credentials are stored locally in your MCP client's config
- No credentials are transmitted over the network
- All Trello API calls use HTTPS
- Rate limiting is respected with automatic retry logic

### Technical Stack
- TypeScript for type safety
- MCP SDK for protocol implementation
- Zod for schema validation
- Fetch API for HTTP requests

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run type checking
npm run type-check
```

### Testing
The server includes comprehensive error handling and validation. Test your setup by:
1. Checking your MCP client's connection status
2. Running a simple command like "Show me my Trello boards"
3. Verifying the response includes your board data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No Trello tools available"**
   - Ensure your MCP client is fully restarted after configuration
   - Check that the path in config points to `dist/index.js`
   - Verify the file exists and is built

2. **"Invalid credentials"**
   - Double-check your API key and token
   - Ensure token has read/write permissions
   - Regenerate token if needed

3. **"Rate limit exceeded"**
   - The server includes automatic retry logic
   - Wait a few minutes if you hit limits
   - Consider reducing request frequency

### Debug Logging
Check your MCP client's logs for connection and error details. For Claude Desktop, logs are at:
- macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-trello.log`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\Logs\mcp-server-trello.log`
